:: About:
:: I decided to make Batch the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Batch) as Batch is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Batch programming language. It only makes sense to Batch the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
